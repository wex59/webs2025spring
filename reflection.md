# Reflection

For my website project, I decided to work on a portfolio that showcases my projects and information about me, such as my skills and hobbies, for recruiters. I first focused on choosing the style I wanted for the website. I struggled with deciding between a clean, tech-inspired portfolio and a pixel-game style portfolio. Eventually, I chose the pixel-game style because I thought it would be more interesting and visually appealing.

## Progress
This is my wireframe for the website.

For my first draft, I organized the sections and implemented some basic design elements to create a pixel-themed website. I also asked one of my friends to test the first draft. The main issues they pointed out were that the text was hard to read and the cloud graphic did not match the pixel aesthetic—it looked too clear compared to the other elements. To fix this, I redesigned the cloud, adjusted the text style, updated the projects section’s design, added pixel-style sparkles, and changed the navigation bar’s background image to better fit the pixel theme.

Before finalizing the updated design, I experimented with different colors, sizes, and text strokes. For example, on the “after” side of the design, I used larger text with a purple color and black stroke, while smaller text used black with a purple stroke. I also tested various colors for the cloud, sparkles, and project section styles, as shown in the image below.

Later, I added a background image to the projects section to fill the empty space and included a footer for contact information.

## Requirements
For the baseline requirements, I believe I met all of them. I used arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and contrast to direct viewers’ attention. The website includes at least three distinct scrolling sections on the same page, a sitewide CSS stylesheet, one fair-use image (self2.jpg, with details in assets.md), and alt text for all images in html. I ensured internal linking between pages, credited all assets properly, tested the website’s functionality in a browser, and used meaningful commit messages.

For the aspirational requirements, I met most of them. I used @media queries and flex-wrap for responsive design, added animated elements via CSS and JavaScript (using @keyframes, :hover, :focus, and :active events), and implemented a JavaScript filter to swap project content. I used flexbox to display projects and lists, shared CSS classes to reduce repetition (e.g., for projects and sparkles), and formatted my code with comments and whitespace for readability. I also used non-default fonts and semantic HTML elements like section, nav, and footer instead of generic div tags. My navigation bar is sticky to help users navigate, and the site is hosted publicly on GitHub Pages. I validated my HTML using an online tool, fixing all errors and warnings.

I also worked on  improving accessibility for multiple audiences. After researching ways, I learned that ARIA attributes could help. For elements like div or interactive components that lacked visible labels, I added aria-label attributes throughout my HTML file. 

## Feedbacks
Feedback 1: 
“Your website looks great so far. you may want to consider increasing the font size of the project descriptions as they are a little small.”

Feedback 2: 
Animation might affect user accessibility, so I added a preference to reduce animation.

I also got some good feedback from my peers:
“ I really like how this project is going, I really liked the start page. I thought it was a nice touch, and the organization of your page is nice.”
“ I think that your site is extremely well done.” 

## Conclusion
Overall, I’m happy with how my website turned out. Even though I had some prior experience with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, this was my first time building a website entirely from scratch. Throughout the project, I gained significant experience with new tools and techniques—such as CSS @keyframes for animations, ARIA attributes for accessibility, and deploying a live site via GitHub Pages. This process challenged me to apply my skills in a practical way and taught me the importance of iterative design and testing.
